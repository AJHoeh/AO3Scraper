My security forms a circle around me as I step towards the microphone.\n",

      "\n",
      "I am offended. Not as a cis white male, but the Facebook RSVPs were for me tonight, not them. So I let it slip out. I’ve gone through so many practice sessions with my staff, late at night, to try to keep it in. But I couldn’t control it, and I now regret it. I didn’t even notice the roar of the crowd had died down, in my anger.\n",

Clinton was infamous for switching positions whenever it was to his advantage, and Sherlock was thankful for that point of criticism. “Well, Levi, thanks for the question. Clearly, the Supreme Court made the only correct decision when they allowed for nationwide gay marriage: or, as I like to call it, marriage. It’s clear from you and your husband that homosexuals can contribute to all marks of society, regardless of their sexual orientation. Love wins.”\n",

And Corey’s working so hard to cover up all your blunders today,” whispered Sherlock, like a cat who had just gotten the cream. He took his long fingers and ran them through John’s crusty hair. “We really should do something about this, shouldn’t we, hmm?” he practically purred into John’s ear.\n",

      "Sherlock laughed. “Unlike you, John, I have no reservations about performing this devious acts.” He stuck his tongue in John’s throat, as if to prove his point, which made taking off Sherlock’s clothes a very challenging task for John.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the shirts finally came off, and the belts were next. John suddenly felt the same nervousness he had felt in the beginning of the debate surge up his spine. If Sherlock knew the truth about his dick, he would never become president, but more importantly, he would never be able to get laid ever again. In that moment, John resolved that his pants would never come off.\n",

      "Sherlock sensed John’s hesitation. “I know you’re worried about not being able to get it up,” he whispered, “but I do love a good challenge.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This only caused John to sweat more: he  was  hard, thanks to the permanent Viagra, but he doubted Sherlock would ever be able to feel anything between his legs.\n",

      "“Now, show Daddy who’s a good boy,” whispered Sherlock, which caused another moan from John, “Weeeeewooooo.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In response, John grabbed Sherlock’s schlong and kissed him long and hard. Sherlock laughed. “You’re a feisty one! Let me return the favor, my dear boy,” he said as he palmed John’s jeans.\n",

Then Brendon was like, ‘Woah woah woah man no homo,’ and Ryan was like, ‘Bitch are you fucking kidding me,’ and then they broke up and now they’re sad and only write songs about each other,” John finished, shoving a Hot Pocket into his jeans.\n",
